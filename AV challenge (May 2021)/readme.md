In May 2021, I participated in a ML competition hosted by Analytics Vidhya. The link for same can be found [here](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/job-a-thon-2/).

Only individual participants were allowed and I ended up 111th on the private leaderboard. I have committed a detailed wolkthrough in the code file.
