NEU surface defect dataset is a set of eighteen hundred (200X200) pixel grey-scale images, published by Northeastern University. Each of these images contains various kind of manufacturing defects that occur on steel surfaces during manufacturing process. Our aim is to classify those defects into six categories viz. (1) surface scratch, (2) pitted surface, (3) rolled-in surface, (4) patches, (5) inclusion, and (6) crazing, simply based on learning from these images.
