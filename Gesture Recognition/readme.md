In this group project, we have been given the set of sequential images and we are going to build a 3D Conv model that will be able to predict the 5 gestures namely,

1. Thumbs up: Increase the volume
2. Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
3. Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
4. Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
5. Stop: Pause the movie

The dataset could be found [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ehyrYBQ5rbQQe6yL4XbLWe3FMvuVUGiL).
